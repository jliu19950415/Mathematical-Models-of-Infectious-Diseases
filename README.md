# Mathematical-Models-of-Infectious-Diseases 
12th Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)  
Instructor(s): Martinez, Micaela, O'Regan, Suzanne  
Module dates/times: Monday, July 13; Tuesday, July 14, and Wednesday, July 15.  

Students are expected to have a working knowledge of the R computing environment. Programming will be in R. Students new to R should complete a tutorial before the module.
This module covers the principles of dynamic models of infectious diseases. This module will focus on developing and analyzing compartmental models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Topics include deriving the basic reproductive ratio using the next generation method, incorporating different mechanisms of heterogeneity in transmission (for instance, age-structure, behavior or seasonality), formulating exact stochastic birth-death models, carrying out sensitivity analysis and statistical fitting of simple models to data. The module will alternate between lectures and computer labs.
